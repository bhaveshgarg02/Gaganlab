                    <p>All of us bleed red – but of various types. It is common knowledge that blood can be classified
                        into different blood
                        groups. Those of us who are a part of any social network that provides a conduit for blood to
                        flow from person to
                        person, know that the following blood groups (or types) exist: A, B, AB, and O. Also familiar to
                        us, is the positive or
                        negative sign that accompanies these basic blood types, further segregating them into eight
                        groups. On what basis, then,
                        are these divisions organised?</p>
                </div>
                <div class="heading">ABO Blood Types</div>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>
                        The ABO grouping system is based on the type of antigens that live on the surface of the red
                        blood cells (RBCs). If the
                        word ‘antigen’ rings a rusty bell, we may recollect that these are protein molecules that
                        stimulate an immune response
                        from the white blood cells (WBCs) in the body. These need not necessarily be foreign bodies: our
                        systemgenerates
                        ‘autoantigens’ on its own as well. The type of autoantigens that our RBCs carry determines our
                        blood group in the
                        following manner: <br>
                        &emsp; > Blood group A has type A antigens (and type B antibodies) <br>
                        &emsp; > Blood group B has type B antigens (and type A antibodies) <br>
                        &emsp; > Blood group AB has type A as well as type B antigens (and no antibodies) <br>
                        &emsp; > Blood group O has no antigens at all (and both types of antibodies) <br>
                        &emsp; > (Antibodies are also protein molecules launched by the body to counter the effect of
                        antigens.)
                    </p>
                    <div class="subheading">Rh Blood Types</div>
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>A further classification is possible based on the Rh (Rhesus) factor. Named after the Rhesus
                            monkey that was mistakenly
                            thought to have the same antigen, this protein – which is also an antigen – is found on the
                            cell membrane of RBCs. The
                            determination of the various types within the Rh factor itself is a complex science, but as
                            far as blood groups are
                            concerned, the classification is based, quite simply, on their presence or absence. Blood
                            that lacks Rh antigens is
                            Rh-negative, and the other kind is Rh-positive. Accordingly, a plus or a minus sign is
                            attached to the ABO
                            classification, giving rise to these types: A+, A-, B+, B-, AB+, AB-, O+, and O-.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="heading">What is the significance of blood typing?</div>
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>The problem and the answer both lie in the antigens. Since these substances trigger immune
                            responses from the body, it
                            is of utmost importance to ensure compatibility before blood transfusions and donations are
                            made. If, for instance, a
                            person of blood group B receives blood of type A, the recipient’s body will label the A-type
                            antigens as foreign bodies,
                            and resist the transfusion. It is for this reason that group AB can receive blood from any
                            type (since it contains and
                            recognises both types of antigens) but group O can only take from type O. The same rule
                            applies for the highly
                            immunogenic Rh-factor as well. Rh-negative mothers who first had an Rh-positive baby might
                            develop antibodies that may
                            harm an Rh-positive baby during the second pregnancy, leading to severe anaemia. It is not
                            surprising, therefore, that
                            many documents – ranging from university applications to employee ID-cards ask for the blood
                            group to be specified.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="heading">What is the testing procedure ?</div>
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>The same principle mentioned above is applied in the laboratory.
                            In the first step, known as forward typing, antibodies that attack type A and type B blood
                            are introduced into the blood
                            sample, and the reaction is observed. If the target blood cells group together, it means
                            that the blood sample has
                            reacted with the antibodies. For instance, anti-A antibodies induce agglutination (grouping
                            or clumping) in type A
                            blood.
                            The second step is called reverse typing, and is performed on the serum left behind after
                            RBCs and WBCs are removed.
                            Blood of a predetermined type (either A or B) is added and its behaviour in the serum is
                            observed – and this should
                            confirm the result of forward typing.
                            The Rh-factor test also follows a similar pattern. Antibodies to Rh are mixed with the blood
                            sample, and if there is a
                            clumping reaction, the blood is Rh-positive.</p>
